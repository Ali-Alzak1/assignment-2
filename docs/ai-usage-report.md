# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT 5 Pro** â€” used for brainstorming and planning features (the ideas were mine; ChatGPT 5 Pro helped refine the approach).  
- **ChatGPT 5** and **GitHub Copilot** â€” helped fix small bugs, rewrite unclear code, and explain why certain errors appeared.  
- **Lovable** â€” handled the complete dark mode styling using my chosen colors and suggested contrast adjustments.

## How AI Was Used
- Planning and improving feature logic for project filtering, sorting, and search.
- Suggesting better structure for the dynamic greeting and theme notification.
- Helping with smooth transitions and scroll animations.
- Improving accessibility and readability for ARIA labels and form feedback.
- Debugging JavaScript for the API section and retry logic.

## My Understanding and Edits
I used AI tools to save time and learn, not to replace understanding.  
I reviewed each generated part, simplified the logic, added comments, and tested everything manually to make sure it worked correctly.

## Benefits
- Faster idea validation and troubleshooting.
- Improved code clarity and accessibility.
- Cleaner dark/light theme design thanks to Lovable.

## Ethics
- No private data was shared.
- All AI tools were used transparently and responsibly.
- Every feature was verified and modified by me before submission.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to combine user interaction, animation, and data handling smoothly.
- Practiced debugging and improving code structure.
- Improved my understanding of accessibility and design tokens.
- Gained hands-on experience with using AI as a coding and design helper responsibly.
