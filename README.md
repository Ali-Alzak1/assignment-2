# Assignment 2 â€“ Interactive Features

This is the second version of my personal portfolio website, expanded from Assignment 1.  
It keeps the same overall structure but adds new interactivity, animations, and small touches that make it more dynamic and engaging.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New in Assignment 2
- Dynamic **greeting** that personalizes based on the user
- **Dark and light mode toggle** with a small notification when the theme changes  
- **Project filtering, searching, and sorting** for easier browsing
- Each project includes **extra details**, plus access to **Figma** (design) or **PDF/PowerPoint** (documentation) files
- **Additional information about me** section using expandable content
- Smooth **animations and transitions** when scrolling or revealing content
- A **simple API feature** (GitHub demo) that shows data loading, error handling, and retry
- Fully **accessible form validation** and toast notifications for feedback

All features build directly on my Assignment 1 portfolio to make it feel more interactive, polished, and user-friendly.

## ðŸ§° Tools and AI Assistance
- **ChatGPT 5 Pro** â€“ helped brainstorm and plan the features I wanted to add (ideas came from me; ChatGPT helped refine them).  
- **ChatGPT 5** and **GitHub Copilot** â€“ assisted with debugging and improving parts of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Lovable** â€“ generated the full dark mode design using my color suggestions and helped refine contrast and accessibility.  

I reviewed and edited all AI suggestions myself to make sure I understood the code and the reasoning behind each feature.
